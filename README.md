# SVQuence.UI

SVQuence.UI is a comprehensive Svelte library designed for creating rich, interactive automation UIs for music, media editing applications, and internal automation tools. It provides a suite of flexible components that let you build a customizable timeline-based interface, including an editable grid for sequencer applications, a timeline player, drag-and-drop timeline sections, and a powerful node editor.

## Components

### 1. AutomationTrack.svelte

This component lets you edit a line graph of points across a timeline. It maps to a variable, allowing you to automate changes in that variable across a given timespan. It's perfect for creating volume or velocity curves in MIDI files.

### 2. Editable Grid

Coming soon, this component will provide a grid of editable rectangles, suitable for piano roll or other sequencer applications.

### 3. Timeline Player

Coming soon, this component will provide a timeline player complete with ticks along the axis and custom timeline cursors.

### 4. Timeline Drag and Drop Section

Coming soon, this component will provide drag-and-drop timeline sections with slicing and other timeline editing functions.

### 5. Node Editor

Coming soon, this powerful tool will allow users to connect predefined nodes and trigger them at points along the timeline. It will also support custom code blocks for user-defined nodes and nodes that visualize output or play audio.

All components are designed to work together seamlessly, with a core layering engine that coordinates SVG elements across components.
